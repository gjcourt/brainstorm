# Real-time MIDI Jazz Voicing Analyzer

## Description

Build a small hardware device with an OLED screen that sits on your piano. It reads MIDI out from
your digital piano, identifies complex jazz chord extensions (e.g., C13#11) in real-time, and
suggests alternative rootless voicings or upper-structure triads.
