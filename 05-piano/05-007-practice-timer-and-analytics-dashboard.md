# Practice Timer and Analytics Dashboard

## Description

Create a comprehensive practice dashboard. Use a foot pedal (from Project 9) to start/stop a timer.
Log the specific pieces, scales, or jazz standards practiced, and generate weekly reports on your
time allocation (e.g., 40% Repertoire, 30% Technique, 30% Improvisation).
