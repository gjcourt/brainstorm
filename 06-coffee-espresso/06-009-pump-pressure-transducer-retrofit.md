# Pump Pressure Transducer Retrofit

## Description

Safely tap into the high-pressure water line of your Lucca A53 Mini (post-pump). Install an
industrial pressure transducer (e.g., 0-15 bar), wire it to an ADC on a microcontroller, and
calibrate the voltage output to accurately read the brew pressure.
