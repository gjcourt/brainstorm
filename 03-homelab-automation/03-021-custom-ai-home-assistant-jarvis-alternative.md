# Custom AI Home Assistant (Jarvis Alternative)

## Description

Build a comprehensive, Jarvis-like personal assistant for the home. Deploy microphones throughout
the house to capture voice commands, convert them to text, and route them through a custom proxy
service. This proxy will use pre-processing logic to determine which LLM(s) should handle the
request. The response will be converted back to audio using a virtually flawless TTS engine with a
unique, custom-generated voice. A key first step of the project is determining an easy, two-syllable
name for the assistant to use as a wake word.
