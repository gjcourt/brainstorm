# Piano Projects (15)

This category focuses on advanced classical repertoire tools, jazz theory, and improvisation.

### 66. Real-time MIDI Jazz Voicing Analyzer
*   **Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-4 weeks
*   **Target Skills:** ESP32, MIDI Parsing, OLED Displays, Jazz Theory
*   **Description:** Build a small hardware device with an OLED screen that sits on your piano. It reads MIDI out from your digital piano, identifies complex jazz chord extensions (e.g., C13#11) in real-time, and suggests alternative rootless voicings or upper-structure triads.

### 67. Jazz Re-harmonization of Bach Inventions
*   **Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Time Commitment:** Months
*   **Target Skills:** Advanced Harmony, Counterpoint, Arrangement, Notation Software (Sibelius/Dorico)
*   **Description:** Take a complex classical piece (e.g., a Bach Two-Part Invention or a Chopin Prelude) and arrange it using advanced jazz harmony (tritone substitutions, secondary dominants, quartal voicings). Document the theoretical analysis and practice the improvisation sections.

### 68. Algorithmic Sight-Reading Generator
*   **Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-4 weeks
*   **Target Skills:** MusicXML/LilyPond, Python/Go, Algorithmic Composition
*   **Description:** Write a program that generates endless, procedurally generated sight-reading exercises tailored to your skill level. Allow parameters for key signature, time signature, rhythmic complexity, and interval leaps, outputting standard sheet music (PDF).

### 69. Chopin Etude Mastery Tracker
*   **Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-2 days
*   **Target Skills:** React/Vue, Local Storage, Data Visualization
*   **Description:** Build a web app specifically for tracking your progress on technically demanding repertoire (like the Chopin Etudes). Log your daily BPM for specific sections, track error rates, and visualize your speed improvements over time.

### 70. Bill Evans Solo Transcription and Analysis
*   **Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Time Commitment:** Months
*   **Target Skills:** Ear Training, Transcription, Harmonic Analysis
*   **Description:** Transcribe a complete, complex jazz piano solo (e.g., Bill Evans on "Waltz for Debby" or "Autumn Leaves") entirely by ear. Notate it in software, analyze the harmonic choices (e.g., use of the melodic minor scale, drop-2 voicings), and learn to play it at tempo.

### 71. MIDI to Sheet Music Transcriber
*   **Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Time Commitment:** Months
*   **Target Skills:** MIDI Parsing, Quantization Algorithms, MusicXML Generation
*   **Description:** Build a tool that takes a raw, unquantized MIDI performance (e.g., an improvisation session) and intelligently transcribes it into readable sheet music. Implement algorithms to guess the time signature, key signature, and separate the left/right hand parts.

### 72. Practice Timer and Analytics Dashboard
*   **Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-4 weeks
*   **Target Skills:** Go Backend, React Frontend, PostgreSQL, WebSockets
*   **Description:** Create a comprehensive practice dashboard. Use a foot pedal (from Project 9) to start/stop a timer. Log the specific pieces, scales, or jazz standards practiced, and generate weekly reports on your time allocation (e.g., 40% Repertoire, 30% Technique, 30% Improvisation).

### 73. Custom Metronome with Polyrhythms
*   **Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-4 weeks
*   **Target Skills:** Web Audio API, JavaScript/TypeScript, UI/UX Design
*   **Description:** Build a highly customizable web-based metronome. Support complex time signatures (e.g., 7/8, 5/4), programmable tempo maps (accelerando/ritardando), and the ability to play multiple conflicting polyrhythms simultaneously (e.g., 4 against 3 against 5).

### 74. Jazz II-V-I Lick Generator
*   **Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-4 weeks
*   **Target Skills:** Python/Go, Music Theory, MIDI Generation
*   **Description:** Write a script that procedurally generates bebop-style II-V-I licks in all 12 keys. Use rules based on voice leading, enclosure, and chromatic approaches. Output the licks as MIDI files or render them directly to sheet music for practice.

### 75. Interactive Circle of Fifths Explorer
*   **Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-2 days
*   **Target Skills:** HTML5 Canvas/SVG, JavaScript, Music Theory
*   **Description:** Create an interactive, visual representation of the Circle of Fifths. Allow clicking on a key to highlight its relative minor, dominant, subdominant, and common chord progressions (like I-vi-IV-V) to aid in memorization and composition.

### 76. Piano Tuning and Temperament Analyzer
*   **Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Time Commitment:** Months
*   **Target Skills:** DSP, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Inharmonicity Calculation
*   **Description:** Build a software tool that listens to a piano string being struck via a microphone. Calculate the fundamental frequency and the exact frequencies of the overtones to measure the string's inharmonicity. Use this data to calculate a custom stretch tuning curve for the instrument.

### 77. Repertoire Spaced Repetition System
*   **Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-4 weeks
*   **Target Skills:** Spaced Repetition Algorithms (SM-2), Database Design, Web App
*   **Description:** Build an app to manage your active repertoire. Instead of flashcards, the "items" are pieces or specific sections of pieces. The app schedules when you should review a piece to ensure it stays in your muscle memory, based on your self-reported performance quality.

### 78. Real-time Performance Velocity Visualizer
*   **Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-4 weeks
*   **Target Skills:** Web MIDI API, D3.js/Canvas, Real-time Data Visualization
*   **Description:** Connect your digital piano to the browser via MIDI. Create a visualization that graphs the velocity (loudness) of every note played in real-time. Use this to practice achieving perfectly even dynamics in scales, arpeggios, or voicing chords where the melody needs to sing above the accompaniment.

### 79. Jazz Standard Chord Progression Database
*   **Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-2 days
*   **Target Skills:** JSON/YAML Parsing, Simple Web Frontend
*   **Description:** Create a structured, searchable database (e.g., in JSON format) of the chord progressions for the top 100 jazz standards. Build a simple frontend to quickly pull up the changes for a song, transpose them to any key, and display Roman numeral analysis.

### 80. Improvisation Backing Track Generator
*   **Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-4 weeks
*   **Target Skills:** MIDI Sequencing, SoundFonts/Virtual Instruments, Python/Go
*   **Description:** Write a program that takes a chord progression (from Project 79) and automatically generates a walking bassline and a drum comping pattern. Render the output as an audio file or stream it via MIDI to use as a backing track for practicing improvisation.
