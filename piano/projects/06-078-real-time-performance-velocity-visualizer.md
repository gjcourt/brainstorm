# Real-time Performance Velocity Visualizer

## Description
Connect your digital piano to the browser via MIDI. Create a visualization that graphs the velocity (loudness) of every note played in real-time. Use this to practice achieving perfectly even dynamics in scales, arpeggios, or voicing chords where the melody needs to sing above the accompaniment.
