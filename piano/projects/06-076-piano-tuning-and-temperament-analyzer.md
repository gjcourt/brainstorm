# Piano Tuning and Temperament Analyzer

## Description
Build a software tool that listens to a piano string being struck via a microphone. Calculate the fundamental frequency and the exact frequencies of the overtones to measure the string's inharmonicity. Use this data to calculate a custom stretch tuning curve for the instrument.
