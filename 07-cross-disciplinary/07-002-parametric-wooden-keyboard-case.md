# Parametric Wooden Keyboard Case

## Description
Design a parametric 3D model for a mechanical keyboard case. Use the model to generate toolpaths for a CNC router (or use traditional woodworking templates) to carve the case out of a solid block of hardwood, ensuring a perfect fit for the PCB and plate.
