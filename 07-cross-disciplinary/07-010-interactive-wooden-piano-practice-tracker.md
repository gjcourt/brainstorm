# Interactive Wooden Piano Practice Tracker

## Description

Build a beautiful wooden board with embedded NFC readers. Create physical wooden "tokens" for each
piece in your repertoire. When you practice a piece, place its token on the board; the ESP32 reads
the tag and automatically logs the practice session to your database (from Project 72).
