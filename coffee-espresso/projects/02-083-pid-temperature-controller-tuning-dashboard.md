# PID Temperature Controller Tuning Dashboard

## Description
Write a script that monitors the temperature of your espresso machine's boiler (either via the `leva!` API or a custom thermocouple). Visualize the heating curve and use the data to manually calculate and optimize the Proportional, Integral, and Derivative values for perfect temperature stability.

## Progress
