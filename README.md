# 100 Multidisciplinary Engineering & Skill-Building Projects

Welcome to the brainstorm repository! This repository contains a curated list of 100 project ideas designed to expand your skill set across software engineering, hardware, woodworking, finance, and music.

## Difficulty Scale

The difficulty of these projects is calibrated to your existing strong software skills (Go, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.):

*   **Easy (1-2 days):** Leverages your existing skills (Go, basic K8s, simple ESPHome/Home Assistant integrations, basic woodworking).
*   **Medium (1-4 weeks):** Combines multiple disciplines, introduces new concepts (basic PCB design, intermediate woodworking, custom sensors, intermediate finance).
*   **Hard (Months):** Ambitious, stretches your skillset into low-level domains (C/C++, RTOS, kernel-level programming, complex DSP, advanced furniture fabrication, advanced financial modeling, complex jazz theory).

## Categories

The 100 projects are divided into the following categories:

1.  **[Audio & MIDI](audio-midi/projects.md)** (15 Projects) - DSP, custom controllers, and audio hardware.
2.  **[Woodworking](woodworking/projects.md)** (15 Projects) - Functional furniture, speaker cabinets, and homelab enclosures.
3.  **[Homelab & Automation](homelab-automation/projects.md)** (20 Projects) - eBPF, K8s operators, ESP32 sensors, and infrastructure.
4.  **[Finance & Analysis](finance-analysis/projects.md)** (15 Projects) - EDGAR parsing, DCF modeling, and personal finance tracking.
5.  **[Piano](piano/projects.md)** (15 Projects) - Advanced classical repertoire tools, jazz theory, and improvisation.
6.  **[Coffee & Espresso](coffee-espresso/projects.md)** (10 Projects) - Lucca A53 profiling, `leva!` firmware, and sensor integration.
7.  **[Cross-Disciplinary](cross-disciplinary/projects.md)** (10 Projects) - Projects that blend multiple categories (e.g., wooden ESP32 audio receivers, mechanical keyboards).
