# Cross-Disciplinary Projects (10)

This category focuses on projects that blend multiple disciplines, such as woodworking, audio, software, and hardware.

### 91. Custom ESP32 Multi-Room Audio Receiver
*   **Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Time Commitment:** Months
*   **Target Skills:** C/C++, I2S DACs, Woodworking, Acoustic Design
*   **Description:** Build a complete, standalone Wi-Fi audio receiver. Write low-level C/C++ firmware for an ESP32 to handle I2S audio streaming and time-sync. Design and build a custom acoustic wooden enclosure (e.g., Walnut or Cherry) to house the electronics, amplifier, and speakers.

### 92. Parametric Wooden Keyboard Case
*   **Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-4 weeks
*   **Target Skills:** 3D Modeling (Fusion 360/OpenSCAD), CNC Routing/Woodworking
*   **Description:** Design a parametric 3D model for a mechanical keyboard case. Use the model to generate toolpaths for a CNC router (or use traditional woodworking templates) to carve the case out of a solid block of hardwood, ensuring a perfect fit for the PCB and plate.

### 93. Custom Mechanical Keyboard Assembly 1 (65% Layout)
*   **Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-2 days
*   **Target Skills:** Soldering, Switch Lubing, QMK/VIA Configuration
*   **Description:** A quick weekend project to assemble a new 65% mechanical keyboard for your homelab workstation. Solder the switches, tune the stabilizers, and flash a custom keymap using QMK or VIA.

### 94. Custom Mechanical Keyboard Assembly 2 (Split Ergonomic)
*   **Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-2 days
*   **Target Skills:** SMD Soldering, ZMK Firmware, TRRS Cables
*   **Description:** Build a split ergonomic keyboard (like a Lily58 or Corne). Solder the diodes, microcontrollers (e.g., Pro Micro or nice!nano), and OLED screens. Configure the ZMK firmware for wireless Bluetooth operation.

### 95. Smart Coffee Table with Built-in Display
*   **Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Time Commitment:** Months
*   **Target Skills:** Furniture Design, Glass/Acrylic Integration, Raspberry Pi/ESP32, UI Design
*   **Description:** Design and build a modern wooden coffee table with a hidden LCD screen beneath a two-way mirror or tinted glass top. Use a Raspberry Pi or ESP32 to display your homelab dashboard, weather, or currently playing music (from Project 91).

### 96. Automated Acoustic Room Treatment
*   **Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Time Commitment:** Months
*   **Target Skills:** Woodworking, Stepper Motors, ESPHome, Acoustic Measurement
*   **Description:** Build motorized acoustic panels or bass traps that can physically rotate or change position based on the room's use (e.g., critical listening vs. casual background music). Control the motors via ESPHome and integrate them into Home Assistant scenes.

### 97. Financial Ticker Display in Hardwood Enclosure
*   **Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-4 weeks
*   **Target Skills:** LED Matrix Displays, Go/Python APIs, Box Making
*   **Description:** Build a dedicated hardware display for your homelab or office that scrolls real-time stock prices, crypto, or your personal portfolio value (from Project 53). House the LED matrix in a custom-built, dovetailed hardwood box.

### 98. MIDI-Controlled Espresso Machine (Joke/Fun)
*   **Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Time Commitment:** Months
*   **Target Skills:** MIDI Parsing, Relays, `leva!` API, Safety Overrides
*   **Description:** A fun, highly complex project. Write a script that translates incoming MIDI notes (from your piano) into commands for your Lucca A53 Mini (via the `leva!` firmware). For example, playing a C major chord starts the pump, and the velocity of the notes controls the pressure profile.

### 99. Homelab Server Rack Acoustic Enclosure
*   **Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Time Commitment:** Months
*   **Target Skills:** Cabinetry, Soundproofing Materials, Thermal Management (Fans/Airflow)
*   **Description:** Build a custom wooden enclosure for your homelab servers that is specifically designed to deaden the noise of high-RPM fans. Line the interior with mass-loaded vinyl and acoustic foam, and design a baffled airflow path with ultra-quiet Noctua fans to maintain cooling.

### 100. Interactive Wooden Piano Practice Tracker
*   **Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Time Commitment:** 1-4 weeks
*   **Target Skills:** Woodworking, RFID/NFC, ESP32, Database Integration
*   **Description:** Build a beautiful wooden board with embedded NFC readers. Create physical wooden "tokens" for each piece in your repertoire. When you practice a piece, place its token on the board; the ESP32 reads the tag and automatically logs the practice session to your database (from Project 72).
