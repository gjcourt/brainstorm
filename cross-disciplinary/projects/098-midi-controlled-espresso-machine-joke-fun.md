# MIDI-Controlled Espresso Machine (Joke/Fun)

## Description
A fun, highly complex project. Write a script that translates incoming MIDI notes (from your piano) into commands for your Lucca A53 Mini (via the `leva!` firmware). For example, playing a C major chord starts the pump, and the velocity of the notes controls the pressure profile.

## Progress
- [ ] Initial research
- [ ] Implementation
- [ ] Documentation
